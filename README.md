# gnss_logger_topography

## Problem Statement
Investigation of how one can use the GNSS Logger application to create topographic maps of any area. Hiring a vendor to perform field surveying using professional GNSS instruments can be costly and time consuming. Instead, use this repo and the GnssLogger application on an Android phone to quickly create a low-cost topographic map.
